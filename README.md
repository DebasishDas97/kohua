1. I have some ts errors in my pages, i think because categories component data value is array where as products are array i guess.
2. I have added the live key of stripe but its giving an error --- IntegrationError: stripe.redirectToCheckout: the provided sessionId is for a live mode Checkout Session, whereas Stripe.js was initialized with a test mode publishable key. ---
3. I have my stripe code in here api/kohua/src/api/order/controllers/order.js and in cart component. please have a look if evrything is alright and iwant to add goggle pay options.
4. also give a overall review on everything.
